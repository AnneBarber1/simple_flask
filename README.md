# What is this repo about?
I'm following a tutorial on CodeFinity on a designing a simple Flask web application that initialises a database of recipes and displays them on the webpage. The application makes use of Python scripting, HTML templates and CSS/Javascript for styling. I'm designing and modifying files in VScode then pushing to this Github repo. The final step will be to test deploying the application in MS Azure.
